E1I1L0	There are now rumblings that Apple might soon invade the smart watch "space," though the company is 
E1I1L1	maintaining its customary silence. The watch doesn't have a microphone or "speaker," but you can use 
E1I1L2	it to control the music on your phone. You can glance at the watch face to view the artist and 
E1I1L3	title of a song. 
E1I2L0	Two days "later," the British astronomer Richard Carrington was observing the interesting sunspot 
E1I2L1	group through his telescope when he saw what he described as two patches of intensely bright and 
E1I2L2	white light over the sunspots. He jotted a note in his painstaking record. That night there was 
E1I2L3	scarcely a square inch of earth that was not illuminated by aurora. 
E1I3L0	I agree that California's three strikes and you're out law will be a financial disaster for 
E1I3L1	taxpayers who care about education and other vital services. But it's far from clear that the law 
E1I3L2	can even be credited with a reduction in crime in California. While it's TRUE that crime declined 
E1I3L3	in California last "year," crime also dropped nationwide. 
E1I4L0	Liza was in a bad "temper," for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the "kitchen," and had been 
E1I4L1	drawn from "them," with a raisin still on her "cheek," by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the 
E1I4L2	best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a "moment," but in custody of 
E1I4L3	course. 
E1I5L0	Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked "out," and the 
E1I5L1	night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the "house," as if curious to see what was to 
E1I5L2	take place "there," but she did not notice "this," nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at 
E1I5L3	her. 
E1I6L0	Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger "poised," he sprang upon the 
E1I6L1	bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for 
E1I6L2	we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect 
E1I6L3	from us at the end. 
E1I7L0	Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was 
E1I7L1	strange. Between the branches of the many roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and "trees," but 
E1I7L2	she couldn't see the farm-house from which she had just "come," or anything she had ever seen "before," 
E1I7L3	except the shaggy man and Toto. 
E1I8L0	The human body can tolerate only a small range of "temperature," especially when the person is 
E1I8L1	engaged in vigorous activity. Heat reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt 
E1I8L2	are lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise. When the body becomes overheated 
E1I8L3	and cannot eliminate this excess "heat," heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible. 
E1I9L0	It was a forbidding "challenge," and it says much for Winstanley's persuasive "abilities," not to 
E1I9L1	mention his "self-confidence," that the admiralty agreed to fund him. No lighthouse had ever been 
E1I9L2	built out to sea on an isolated rock before. The Eddystone is hard enough to "avoid," but landing on 
E1I9L3	it is a separate challenge entirely. 
E1I10L0	A clergyman remarked to "him," The Lord is on our side. I am not at all concerned about "that," 
E1I10L1	replied Mr. Lincoln; for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my 
E1I10L2	constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side. 
E1I11L0	Known as Rapa Nui to the island's "inhabitants," Rongorongo is a writing system comprised of 
E1I11L1	pictographs. It has been found carved into many oblong wooden tablets and other artifacts from the 
E1I11L2	island's history. The art of writing was not known in any nearby islands and the script's mere 
E1I11L3	existence is sufficient to confound anthropologists. 
E1I12L0	Some months "later," Michael Larson saw another opportunity to stack the odds in his favor with a 
E1I12L1	dash of ingenuity. He walked into his bank one day and asked to withdraw his entire account 
E1I12L2	"balance," but with an unusual stipulation: He wanted as much of the cash as possible in one dollar 
E1I12L3	notes. 
E1I13L0	Bob "Murphy," the Senior PGA Tour money leader with seven hundred "thousand," says heat shouldn't be a 
E1I13L1	factor. I don't think you're going to have a heat wave I'm not going to be able to "handle," he 
E1I13L2	said. Everybody treats it differently. My son "Ronnie," his "caddie," and I won't be riding carts. 
E1I14L0	With schools still "closed," cars still buried and streets still blocked by the widespread weekend 
E1I14L1	"snowstorm," officials are asking people to pick up a shovel and help out. In "Boston," a snow angel 
E1I14L2	campaign is using social media to encourage neighbors and friends to be an angel and help dig out 
E1I14L3	the stranded. 
E1I15L0	Greg "Anderson," considered a key witness by the "prosecution," vowed he wouldn't testify when served a 
E1I15L1	subpoena last week. His lawyers said he was prepared for a third prison stay to maintain his 
E1I15L2	silence. Anderson was released July 20 after a two-week stay for previously declining to testify 
E1I15L3	before a different grand jury. 
E1I16L0	Steam sterilization is limited in the types of medical waste it can "treat," but is appropriate for 
E1I16L1	laboratory cultures and substances contaminated with infectious organisms. The waste is subjected 
E1I16L2	to steam in a "sealed," pressurized chamber. The liquid that may form is drained off to the sewer or 
E1I16L3	sent for processing. 
E1I17L0	Owls are more flexible than humans because a bird's head is only connected by one socket pivot. 
E1I17L1	People have "two," which limits our ability to "twist," Forsman added. Owls also have multiple 
E1I17L2	"vertebrae," the small bones that make up the neck and "spine," helping them achieve a wide range of 
E1I17L3	motion. 
E1I18L0	Even in the same "animal," not all bites are the same. A new study finds that because the force in a 
E1I18L1	muscle depends on how much it is "stretched," an animal's bite force depends on the size of what it 
E1I18L2	is biting. The finding has direct implications for ecology and evolution. 
E1I19L0	"Interestingly," the heaviest isotopes physicists have managed to synthesize so far don't behave 
E1I19L1	quite like science's best current models "predict," so stable superheavy nuclei are likely to be full 
E1I19L2	of surprises. Chemists cannot even predict with any certainty whether these materials will exist as 
E1I19L3	"gases," "liquids," or solids at room temperature. 
E1I20L0	Buck did not like "it," but he bore up well to the "work," taking pride in it. It was a monotonous 
E1I20L1	"life," operating with machine-like regularity. One day was very like another. At a certain time each 
E1I20L2	morning the cooks turned "out," fires were "built," and breakfast was eaten. 
E1I21L0	These "days," neuroscience is beginning to catch up to musicians who practice mentally. Although the 
E1I21L1	details are still somewhat "elusive," the key to the success of mental imagery as a rehearsal 
E1I21L2	technique is that most of the same neurological regions are invoked by mental practice as by real 
E1I21L3	practice. 
E1I22L0	Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's "voices," for so safe did the boys feel in 
E1I22L1	their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering. The pirates listened "grimly," and then replaced 
E1I22L2	the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees. 
E1I23L0	When a nucleus has all of its proton shells or neutron shells loaded to full "capacity," the layers 
E1I23L1	can align so well that each shell can spoon intimately with its attractive "neighbors," forming a 
E1I23L2	more compact sphere that fits well within the strong nuclear force's area of influence. 
E1I24L0	Hybrid vehicles have a halo that makes owners feel righteous and their neighbors feel guilty for 
E1I24L1	not doing as much to save the planet. They also cost more and a new report from the very green 
E1I24L2	Union of Concerned Scientists says buyers aren't always getting their money's worth. 
E1I25L0	The girl's feet were then re-wrapped even tighter than "before," causing her footprint to shrink 
E1I25L1	further as the bones slowly fused into their new configuration. Occasionally girls' feet would 
E1I25L2	"fester," and blood poisoning from gangrene could be a cause for "concern," but an estimated 90% 
E1I25L3	survived the process. 
E1I26L0	An early task will be to make sure the newfound microbes were not introduced while drilling through 
E1I26L1	the ice into the "lake," which involved a hot-water drilling technique designed to greatly reduce or 
E1I26L2	eliminate any contamination that might come from other kerosene-based drilling "technology," 
E1I26L3	Christner said. 
E1I27L0	Very "similar," but even more "striking," is the evidence from athletic training. As with rehearsing a 
E1I27L1	piece on the "piano," practicing a complex physical task in the mind alone is nearly as effective a 
E1I27L2	learning strategy as actually physically doing it. But it doesn?t stop there. 
E1I28L0	A bill was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times but met with great "opposition," 
E1I28L1	mostly from farmers. "Eventually," in "1925," it was decided that summer time should begin on the day 
E1I28L2	following the third Saturday in April and close after the first Saturday in October. 
E1I29L0	When early Europeans discovered Easter "Island," its somewhat isolated ecosystem was suffering from 
E1I29L1	the effects of limited natural "resources," "deforestation," and overpopulation. Over the following 
E1I29L2	years the island's population of four thousand or so was slowly eroded by Western disease and 
E1I29L3	deportation by slave traders. 
E1I30L0	Binge drinking may not necessarily kill or even damage brain "cells," as commonly "thought," a new 
E1I30L1	animal study suggests. But it can block key receptors in the brain and trigger production of a 
E1I30L2	steroid that interferes with brain functions critical to learning and memory. 
E1I31L0	When preparing to check out of their hotel "room," some frequent travelers pile up their used bath 
E1I31L1	towels on the bathroom "floor," which would make them easy for housekeepers to spot. Other travelers 
E1I31L2	neatly fold "them," or hang them from the shower curtain pole. 
E1I32L0	In no celestial "hurry," Neptune has just completed its first orbit around the sun since being 
E1I32L1	discovered 165 years ago by Earthlings. As Space.com "notes," the big blue-green gas bag is the only 
E1I32L2	planet in our solar system to be discovered by mathematics. 
E1I33L0	When "attacked," a skunk's natural inclination is to turn "around," lick its tail and spray a noxious 
E1I33L1	scent. That works when a skunk faces a natural predator in the "wild," but it's not as helpful when 
E1I33L2	faced "with," let's "say," an oncoming car. 
E1I34L0	Lady Gaga's YouTube account was suspended Thursday. The notice read that the suspension was due to 
E1I34L1	multiple or severe violations of YouTube's copyright policy. The Google Inc.-owned YouTube 
E1I34L2	declined to comment. It's YouTube policy to remove accounts after three copyright violations. 
E1I35L0	The astronauts used a hefty robotic arm to move the bus-size "canister," stuffed with nearly three 
E1I35L1	tons of packing foam and other space station refuse. It was the last job shared by the shuttle and 
E1I35L2	station "crews," numbering ten astronauts altogether. 
E1I36L0	Rich investors with no ties to "farming," no dirt under their "nails," are confident enough to wager 
E1I36L1	big on a patch of earth ? betting that it's a smart investment because food will only get more 
E1I36L2	expensive around the world. 
E1I37L0	John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the wild. With a handful of salt 
E1I37L1	and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he 
E1I37L2	pleased. 
E1I38L0	All that the brain has to work with are imperfect incoming electrical impulses announcing that 
E1I38L1	things are happening. It is then the job of neurons to rapidly interpret these signals as well as 
E1I38L2	they "can," and suggest how to react. 
E1I39L0	That's because when immigrants from a particular cultural group move into a new "one," they bring 
E1I39L1	genetic diversity "that," if the immigrants have "children," get mixed "around," changing the new 
E1I39L2	population's gene pool. But the new population's culture doesn't necessarily change. 
E1I40L0	Police in Georgia have shut down a lemonade stand run by three girls trying to save up for a trip 
E1I40L1	to a water "park," saying they didn't have a business license or the required permits. Morningstar 
E1I40L2	says police also didn't know how the lemonade was made. 
E1I41L0	Research showing that a tiny European river bug called the water boatman may be the loudest animal 
E1I41L1	on earth for its size has some interesting sidebars. The insect is just two millimeters long and 
E1I41L2	yet produces an underwater call that has been measured at 99.2 decibels. 
E1I42L0	There often seems to be more diving in soccer than in the Summer Olympics. Phantom "contact," or the 
E1I42L1	slightest "collision," can lead to theatrical belly flops and exaggerated somersaults by players 
E1I42L2	deceptively trying to draw fouls on their "opponents," kill time or catch a breather when tired. 
E1I43L0	Proper ventilation will make a backdraft less likely. Opening a room or building at the highest 
E1I43L1	point allows heated gases and smoke to be released gradually. "However," suddenly breaking a window 
E1I43L2	or opening a door is a "mistake," because it allows oxygen to rush "in," causing an explosion. 
E1I44L0	The first step to be taken in studying the history of our country is to form some clear and proper 
E1I44L1	conception of the characteristics and condition of the territory which is now occupied by the 
E1I44L2	American "people," as it existed when first discovered and explored by Europeans. 
E1I45L0	Susan B. Anthony spent nearly sixty years of her life devoted to the cause of social justice and 
E1I45L1	equality for all. Her major contributions were focused on women?s rights. Her primary achievement 
E1I45L2	lay in her inspiration and influence of thousands of people promoting the right of women to vote. 
E1I46L0	As Earth warms due to the human-caused release of heat-trapping gases into the "atmosphere," frozen 
E1I46L1	Arctic soils also "warm," thaw and release more carbon dioxide. The added carbon dioxide accelerates 
E1I46L2	Earth's "warming," which further accelerates the thawing of Arctic soils and the release of even more 
E1I46L3	carbon dioxide. 
E1I47L0	"Unfortunately," for every six water bottles we "use," only one makes it to the recycling bin. The rest 
E1I47L1	are sent to landfills "or," even "worse," they end up as trash on the land and in "rivers," "lakes," and 
E1I47L2	the ocean. Plastic bottles take many hundreds of years to disintegrate. 
E1I48L0	As in the United "States," Colombian legislation requires travelers entering the country to declare 
E1I48L1	cash in excess of ten thousand dollars. Concealing more than that amount to transport it into or 
E1I48L2	out of the country is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison in the United States. 
E1I49L0	For "centuries," time was measured by the position of the sun with the use of sundials. Noon was 
E1I49L1	recognized when the sun was the highest in the "sky," and cities would set their clock by this 
E1I49L2	apparent solar "time," even though some cities would often be on a slightly different time. 
E1I50L0	When the new world was first discovered it was found to "be," like the "old," well stocked with plants 
E1I50L1	and "animals," and inhabited by a great many tribes and nations of men; and yet the plants and 
E1I50L2	"animals," if not the "men," were all essentially different from those known in the old world. 
E1I51L0	American industry may not know "it," but debate in Congress over reforming the federal government's 
E1I51L1	regulatory apparatus may profoundly improve companies' ability to survive. This week the Senate 
E1I51L2	seems poised to join the House in a massive overhaul of the way in which bureaucrats enact 
E1I51L3	regulations that are strangling the life out of companies. 
E1I52L0	Stress is a risk factor for both depression and "anxiety," he says. We don't have data on the 
E1I52L1	specific causes of depression and anxiety in this "sample," but it does make sense scientifically 
E1I52L2	that the Millennials who report higher levels of stress in their lives are also reporting higher 
E1I52L3	levels of depression and anxiety. 
E1I53L0	When it comes to having a lasting and fulfilling "relationship," common wisdom says that feeling 
E1I53L1	close to your romantic partner is paramount. But a new study finds that it's not how close you feel 
E1I53L2	that matters "most," it's whether you are as close as you want to "be," even if that's really not close 
E1I53L3	at all. 
E1I54L0	At the time the French crown secured much of its revenue by issuing government bonds. In "1727," in 
E1I54L1	order to save "money," the state cut the bonds? interest rate. The market value of these bonds 
E1I54L2	"plummeted," and the market became wary of French credit. The French state was left without an easy 
E1I54L3	way of raising money. 
E1I55L0	Voltaire himself probably won around half a million livres--a large "fortune," which he then made 
E1I55L1	even larger in a series of canny investments. Soon Voltaire was a very rich "man," rich enough to 
E1I55L2	become a moneylender to the powerful and "famous," rich enough that he no longer had to stake his 
E1I55L3	financial well-being on that most unreliable and detestable profession--writing.
